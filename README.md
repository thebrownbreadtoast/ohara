## üåê Network & DNS Architecture

Ohara is designed for seamless access both at home and remotely:

- **Pi-hole** acts as the DNS server for your local network and for remote clients via Tailscale.
- Your router is configured to use Pi-hole as the default DNS, so all local devices resolve `ohara.com` to your homeserver.
- **Tailscale** is set up to use Pi-hole as its DNS, so when you are remote, `ohara.com` still resolves to your homeserver over the secure Tailscale network.
- This means you can access your homeserver at `http://ohara.com` from anywhere‚Äîno matter if you‚Äôre at home or away!
