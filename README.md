## 🏡 What is Ohara?

**Ohara** is a self-hosted, modular homeserver stack powered by Docker Compose. It brings together essential services for your home network, all managed with health monitoring and a beautiful dashboard.

## 🚀 Features

- **One-command deployment** with Docker Compose
- **Service health monitoring** with [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io) and [Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet)
- **Modern dashboard** with [Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer)
- **Media streaming** ([Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org)), **downloads** ([qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org)), **ad-blocking** ([Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net)), and more!
- **Easy configuration** and extensibility

## 🌐 Network & DNS Architecture

Ohara is designed for seamless access both at home and remotely:

- **Pi-hole** provides DNS for your local network and remote clients via Tailscale.
- Your router points to Pi-hole as the default DNS, so all local devices resolve `ohara.com` and service subdomains to your homeserver.
- **Tailscale** is configured to use Pi-hole for DNS, so when remote, `ohara.com` and all services resolve securely over the Tailscale network.
- All services are reverse-proxied via Nginx for unified access, whether on your LAN or remotely.

## 🩺 Health Monitoring

- **Uptime Kuma** is used for real-time monitoring of all services, with a web dashboard for statuses.
- **Healthchecks.io** is used to track if the server is alive, with periodic pings from the system (e.g., via cron or scheduled tasks).
- Each service is reverse-proxied and monitored for uptime and reachability.
